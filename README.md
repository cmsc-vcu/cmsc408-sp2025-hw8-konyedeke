Homework 8 - World Bank Indicator Analysis

(This project connects to a preloaded World Bank dataset and explores country-level data using SQL queries inside a Quarto report.
The goal was to build skills in data exploration, aggregation, and transformation using SQL fundamentals

Python was used to connect to a MySQL database using a custom helper module.

Environment variables were loaded from a local .env file to protect sensitive credentials.

Quarto was used to combine SQL results and markdown commentary into a single organized report.

Through this assignment, I strengthened my ability to write structured SQL queries for real-world data analysis.
I learned how important it is to break down problems, verify assumptions early, and structure queries cleanly, especially when dealing with complex data transformations.

The .env file is kept private and not included in the repository for security reasons.

Database: world_bank_data was provided and must be preloaded locally for queries to work.

All queries were written manually to reinforce understanding of SQL patterns and best practices.)

(Remember, someday you'll look back at this repo and wonder what you were thinking!
Now is your chance to remind your future self what you were thinking!)
